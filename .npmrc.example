# GitHub Packages configuration
# Copy this file to .npmrc in your project root
# This file is gitignored, so you can safely put your token here
#
# For Yarn v1: Replace YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE with your actual token
# For npm or Yarn v2+: You can use ${GITHUB_TOKEN} if the env var is set
#
# Note: The deploy script (yarn loui:deploy) handles authentication automatically
# and doesn't require this file. This .npmrc is mainly for installing packages.
